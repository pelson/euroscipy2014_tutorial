YAML is an excellent data serialisation format similar to JSON with a few extra benefits, notably including the ability to write comments. This makes YAML a great choice for writing configuration files or simply for storing human readable data.\n",

      "An important thing to note about YAML is that it is an extensible serialisation language, meaning it is possible to define our own complex types and ultimately construct arbitrary Python objects. This is great, but it does open us up to potentially malicious intents, [so we use the ``yaml.safe_load`` function](http://pyyaml.org/wiki/PyYAMLDocumentation#LoadingYAML) when dealing with any data which may be untrusted:"
